# 🗣️ VoiceAssistant

A simple, interactive voice assistant built using **Streamlit**, **SpeechRecognition**, and **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** libraries in Python. This application captures user voice input, processes it, and responds using audio output.

---

## 📌 Description

The **VoiceAssistant** is designed to serve as a basic yet functional virtual assistant. It uses:

- **SpeechRecognition** for converting spoken commands to text.
- **pyttsx3** for converting text responses to speech.
- **Streamlit** to offer a user-friendly, browser-based interface.

This project is part of our academic open-source contribution under Swecha’s IP1 Program at ICFAI Tech Hyderabad.
